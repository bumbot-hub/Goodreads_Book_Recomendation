# GoodReads Recommendation System

## Summary

The GoodReads Recommendation System aims to create a personalized system that helps users discover new books based on their individual tastes and preferences. By leveraging data from Goodreads, such as user ratings and book shelf information, the system generates book suggestions that are highly relevant to each user’s unique reading habits.

The recommendation engine combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. Collaborative filtering analyzes patterns in which books user have in shelves and how they rate it, suggesting titles that similar users have enjoyed. Content-based filtering focuses on book metadata, such as genre, author, and other attributes, to recommend books with similar characteristics to the ones a user has rated highly. By combining these methods, the system ensures that recommendations are personalized, taking into account both the user’s direct preferences and the characteristics of the books themselves.

This system aims to solve the common problem of finding books that align with a user’s specific interests in an overwhelming catalog of titles. By using artificial intelligence to analyze and cross-reference large datasets, the system offers a tailored experience that minimizes the effort of browsing irrelevant suggestions. Additionally, the project focuses on enhancing the quality of recommendations by combining multiple AI approaches, ensuring that users are offered a diverse range of books that are still aligned with their tastes.


## Background

Many readers struggle to find new books that match their interests despite vast catalogs available online. Goodreads offers rich data on user preferences, but personalized recommendations can still be improved. 

My motivation comes from a passion for reading and the desire to leverage AI to help readers discover books they will truly enjoy. This project addresses:

- Difficulty in finding relevant book suggestions tailored to personal taste
- Underutilization of publicly available user rating and review data
- Enhancing recommendation quality by combining multiple AI approaches

## How is it used?

Users provide their Goodreads data export (ratings, reviews, shelves). The system processes this data along with anonymized datasets from other users to generate personalized book recommendations.

Typical use cases include:

- Readers looking for new books similar to their favorites
- Users wanting to explore genres or authors aligned with their preferences
- Book clubs seeking tailored reading lists

The solution can be integrated into web or mobile apps and used anytime readers want new suggestions based on their profile.

## Data Sources and AI Methods

- User data exported from Goodreads profiles (ratings, reviews, shelves)
- Public Goodreads datasets from platforms like Kaggle containing millions of user ratings and reviews
- AI methods: collaborative filtering (user-based and item-based), content-based filtering (using book metadata and text embeddings), and hybrid recommendation models
- Tools: Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Surprise, TensorFlow/PyTorch for model building

## Challenges

- **Data sparsity**: Some users have few ratings, making recommendations less accurate.
- **Cold start problem**: New users or books without sufficient data face difficulties in making accurate recommendations.
- **Balancing diversity and relevance**: Avoiding echo chambers while ensuring recommendations remain relevant.
- **Ethical considerations**: Addressing user data privacy and anonymization.
- **Bias in recommendations**: Ensuring recommendations don’t reinforce biases in user preferences or popular books only.

## What’s next?

Future improvements could include:

- Incorporating sentiment analysis of reviews to better understand user preferences
- Adding social network data (friends’ recommendations) to enhance collaborative filtering
- Developing a real-time recommendation engine with continuous learning
- Building a user-friendly interface for easy data upload and personalized results
- Exploring multimodal data (book covers, author interviews) for richer content-based filtering
